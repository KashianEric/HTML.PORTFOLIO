<h1>ABOUT ME</h1>

<p>I am Kashian Eric Apilan. I graduated with a Bachelor's Degree in Secondary Education major in English (Teaching Language and Literature). I am also a licensed teacher in the Philippines. After I graduated, I worked as an ESL (English as a Second Language) Teacher for a year. After that, I worked in a BPO (Business Process Outsourcing) company as a Customer Service Representative for 2 years. Then, I got a job offer to work in Japan as a teacher. I worked there for 7 years in Public Elementary and Junior High Schools and I also taught English to adult learners.

<p>I am currently shifting my career in Web Development. I saw the demand and this was also what I have been wanting to do even before I took my Education Degree. To be honest, it is very challenging to shift something that you have used to doing to a career which is not your forte. But I guess, going out from your comfort zone isn't bad at all. You see better opportunities.</p>

<p>I am hope I would be able to learn so many things to be a Web/Software Developer in the future.</p>
